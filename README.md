welcome to my github page, which there is probably nthn here at the time of u reading this.  
i only post stuff if it's like an old driver i don’t use anymore, usually cuz it’s detected or just straight garbage 💔  
don’t expect anything crazy like a full anticheat bypass

### what i do:
- c
- c++
- kernel stuff (learning heavy rn)

still very early in the learning phase, especially in kernel 
i’m not perfect and won’t be for a few years.  
every day’s a new learning experience depending on how it goes.
